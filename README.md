# Text Extraction from Images

## Overview

This project uses Python and various libraries to extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It employs the `easyocr` library to read text and utilizes OpenCV for image processing. The program processes an image to detect text areas and extracts the text, displaying the results.

## Libraries Used

- **easyocr**: A Python library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: A library for computer vision and image processing.
- **imutils**: A collection of convenience functions for OpenCV.
- **matplotlib**: A plotting library to visualize images.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using `pip`. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install easyocr opencv-python imutils matplotlib
